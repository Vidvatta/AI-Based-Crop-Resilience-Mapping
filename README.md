# AI-Based-Crop-Resilience-Mapping
This project presents an AI-based downscaling framework to convert coarse climate data into fine-resolution local estimates and integrate them with crop yield data to generate crop resilience maps. Machine learning models are trained using historical climate &amp; crop datasets to predict yield under changing climatic conditions.
